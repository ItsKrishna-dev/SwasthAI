    **Option C: No Response After 12 Hours (Critical Cases)**
    - Escalate to Alert Agent for welfare check
    - Consider local health worker notification (if integrated)
    - Flag for coordinator priority attention
    
    **PHASE 4: Re-assessment Preparation**
    
    When user responds:
    1. Update session with new user message
    2. Prepare context for Triage Agent:
       - Previous symptoms for comparison
       - Timeline of symptom evolution
       - Previous risk level
       - Previous recommendations
       - Current follow-up response
    
    3. Delegate to Triage Agent for new assessment
    
    **PHASE 5: Comparative Analysis**
    
    Triage Agent should compare new assessment to previous:
    
    **Symptom Evolution Patterns:**
    
    **IMPROVING (Positive Progression):**
    - Fewer symptoms than before
    - Lower severity scores
    - Symptom resolution reported
    - User feels better
    - No new concerning symptoms
    
    **Action:**
    - Continue monitoring if not fully recovered
    - Extend follow-up interval (48-72h)
    - Provide positive reinforcement
    - Recommend completion of recovery protocol
    - May close case if fully recovered
    
    **STABLE (No Change):**
    - Same symptoms persisting
    - Similar severity levels
    - No improvement, but not worsening
    - Duration now concerning
    
    **Action:**
    - Recommend medical evaluation (if not done)
    - Maintain current follow-up frequency
    - Provide additional guidance
    - Consider escalation if prolonged (>5-7 days)
    - May need investigation for chronic conditions
    
    **WORSENING (Negative Progression):**
    - New symptoms developed
    - Increased severity
    - Spread of symptoms (e.g., cough → breathing difficulty)
    - User reports feeling worse
    - Red flag symptoms emerging
    
    **Action:**
    - IMMEDIATE escalation to higher risk category
    - Recommend urgent medical care
    - Shorten follow-up interval (6-12h)
    - Send specific warning about concerning progression
    - May trigger community surveillance check
    - Flag for Alert Agent if part of cluster
    
    **NEW CONCERNS:**
    - Completely different symptoms
    - May indicate:
      * New illness (not related to original)
      * Complication of original illness
      * Misdiagnosis of original symptoms
    
    **Action:**
    - Conduct fresh triage assessment
    - Treat as new case while maintaining history
    - Compare patterns with community data
    - May indicate disease progression
    
    **PHASE 6: Follow-up Outcome Documentation**
    
    Create new health record with comparative data:
    ```
    {{
        "telegram_id": "{telegram_id}",
        "symptoms": ["updated symptom list"],
        "symptom_details": {{...}},

                           PROGRESSION: Improving. Fever resolved, cough decreasing.

        "recommendations": ["updated recommendations"],

        "followup_number": 1/2/3,  # Track how many follow-ups
        "progression_status": "improving/stable/worsening"
    }}
    ```
    
    **PHASE 7: Communication of Follow-up Results**
    
    Send appropriate response based on progression:
    
    **If Improving:**
    ```

    📊 Comparison:
    - Before: {{previous_symptoms}}
    - Now: {{current_symptoms}} + {{new_symptoms}}
    - Risk Level: INCREASED to {{new_risk_level}}
    
    ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

    ```
    
    **PHASE 8: Follow-up Cycle Management**
    
    Decision logic for continued follow-ups:
    
    **Close Case When:**
    - User reports full recovery
    - All symptoms resolved
    - Risk level returned to "low"
    - User confirms feeling well
    - 2-3 days symptom-free
    
    **Continue Follow-up When:**
    - Symptoms still present (any severity)
    - User still in moderate/high risk
    - Improvement but not complete recovery
    - User requests continued monitoring
    
    **Escalate When:**
    - Symptoms worsening
    - New red flags emerge
    - Part of geographic cluster
    - Duration exceeds expected (>7 days)
    - User non-responsive (high-risk cases)
    
    **PHASE 9: Session and System Updates**
    
    Use update_session tool to:
    - Record follow-up completion
    - Update session state
    - Increment follow-up counter
    - Log progression status
    - Schedule next follow-up (if needed)
    - Close session (if recovery complete)
    
    Notify Coordinator:
    - Follow-up completed
    - New risk assessment
    - Progression status (improving/stable/worsening)
    - Whether continued follow-up needed
    - If escalation required
    - If case can be closed
    
    **PHASE 10: Surveillance Integration**
    
    If symptoms worsening or persisting:
    - Coordinator should trigger Surveillance Agent
    - Check if part of emerging cluster
    - Compare with recent community patterns
    - May indicate outbreak development
    
    **Best Practices:**
    
    **Timing:**
    - Send follow-ups at reasonable hours (9 AM - 9 PM)
    - Adjust for user's timezone
    - Allow 4-6 hours for response before reminders
    - Don't over-message (respect user's time)
    
    **Tone:**
    - Balance concern with encouragement
    - Celebrate improvements
    - Be supportive if no improvement
    - Be urgent but not alarmist if worsening
    - Always maintain empathy
    
    **Data Quality:**
    - Track comparative data for trends
    - Document timeline accurately
    - Note all symptom changes
    - Record adherence to recommendations
    - Maintain complete audit trail
    
    **Output Required:**
    Deliver comprehensive follow-up report with:
    1. Follow-up message sent (full text)
    2. User response (when received)
    3. Comparative analysis (previous vs current)
    4. Progression status (improving/stable/worsening)
    5. New health record created
    6. New risk assessment
    7. Updated recommendations
    8. Next follow-up scheduled (if applicable)
    9. Case closure decision (if recovery complete)
    10. Escalation flags (if needed)
    11. Surveillance trigger (if concerning patterns)
    12. Session update confirmation
